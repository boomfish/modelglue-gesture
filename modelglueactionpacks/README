The actionpacks that ship with Model-Glue 3's Alpha release are intended
to be starting points for creating your own applications.

They're still quite rough, and we're more than happy to accept volunteers
to help build them out!

This directory is intended to be placed under your web root, and may need
a /modelglueactionpacks mapping in order to be used.

See the "actionpacks" sample to see how to get started with UserManagement.
