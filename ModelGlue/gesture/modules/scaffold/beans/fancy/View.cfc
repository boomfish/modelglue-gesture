<cfcomponent extends="ModelGlue.gesture.modules.scaffold.beans.plain.View" output="false" hint="I am used whever type=""list"" is used in a scaffold tag.">
<!---
	This bean is currently identical to the plain View bean, so we're just extending that. 
	The difference in output is achieved by mapping a different set of custom tags to the mg: namespace via the 
	Coldspring scaffoldCustomTagMappings property
